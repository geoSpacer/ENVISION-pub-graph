# ENVISION-pub-graph
Use run_reports.py to start graph run for single ENVISON scenario (multiple reps is fine). Graphs are written out at PDFs in the same directory as the .csv files that have the ENVISION output.

Use run_reports6.py to start graph run for multiple ENVISION scenarios. Multiple reps detected in each scenario will be averaged and 95th percentile confidence intervals are plotted in most cases.
